# front-ready
A project that contains Grunt configured for using with the most commom packages from them.
It's a simple project for learning. There are no interest in it beyond using Grunt.

If you want to create a new project, I strongly advise you to use [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

Following are the installed Grunt Plugins.
